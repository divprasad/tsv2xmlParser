# tsv2xmlParser

Parsers for (programmatic) read submission to [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home).

Parses a .tsv file & converts to the equivalent .xml file.
  
  
#### `createSampleXml.py`

takes one tsv file as the argument; tsv has the format:

| "alias" | "date" | "province" | "isolateName" | "GisaidID" |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
|Run3zz_BC01 | 2020-11-19 | somewhere north | hCoV-19/Netherlands/xy-ZZZ-1001/2020 | EPI_ISL_xyyxzz |  
|Run3zz_BC02 | 2020-10-14 | somewhere south | hCoV-19/Netherlands/xy-ZZZ-1002/2020 | EPI_ISL_xyyxzz |  
|Run3zz_BC03 | 2020-11-18 | somewhere south | hCoV-19/Netherlands/xy-ZZZ-1003/2020 | EPI_ISL_xyyxzz |  
|Run3zz_BC04 | 2020-11-19 | somewhere north | hCoV-19/Netherlands/xy-ZZZ-1004/2020 | EPI_ISL_xyyxzz |  
|.. | .. | .. | .. | .. |  
|.. | .. | .. | .. | .. |  
  
  
#### `createRunXml.py` and `createExpXml.py`
take one tsv file as the argument; tsv has the format:

| "samAlias" | "expAlias" | "gzFile" | "md5"
--- | --- | --- | --- 
| Run3zz_BCyy | Exp_Run3zz_BCyy | path_to_folder/Run3zz_BCyy.fastq.gz | 5bc7e43c01f76709b2c0d89b1f50264b  
| Run3zz_BCyy | Exp_Run3zz_BCyy | path_to_folder/Run3zz_BCyy.fastq.gz | acad7c8f729469556c58abd0f30c88cd  
| Run3zz_BCyy | Exp_Run3zz_BCyy | path_to_folder/Run3zz_BCyy.fastq.gz | 6f7fed624f91cb4f8512b96c4d9b1dec  
| Run3zz_BCyy | Exp_Run3zz_BCyy | path_to_folder/Run3zz_BCyy.fastq.gz | b0f2ca8884b6ff7e35563d055e9c7d1a  
|.. | .. | .. | .. |  
|.. | .. | .. | .. |  

where path_to_folder/ is relative to the root directory in the user account of the ENA ftp drop-box.   

**Usage:** `python createRunXml.py runxy-yz.tsv` produces the output runxy-yz.xml  
  
  
#### (test) programmatic submission of samples, runs, and experiments  

```
curl -u Webin-USER:PASS -F "SUBMISSION=@submission.xml" -F "RUN=@runxy-yz.xml" -F "EXPERIMENT=@expxy-yz.xml" "https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/submit/" >> runExpLog.txt 2>&1   
```

`runExpLog.txt` file stores the progress and error logs

When tests are successful, *replace* the url https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/submit/ with https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/drop-box/submit/ for publishing.
